# This test contains a parent route that delegates to a child route. A traffic policy targets
# the parent route.
# This is mainly to ensure no nil pointer dereference when applying the policy,
# since a parent route rule with a delegated backend will not have outputRoute.RouteAction set.
# Testing with autoHostRewrite since it is applied to the route action.
